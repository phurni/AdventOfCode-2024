# AdventOfCode 2024

You'll find here [my](https://github.com/phurni) solutions to the [Advent Of Code of 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

My language of choice still is Ruby, nothing beats its expressiveness and great builtins.

Running the solution takes usually the following form:

    ruby dayN_partX.rb dayN.in

where `N` is the day number, `X` is either 1 or 2 for the challenge part, and `dayN.in` contains the downloaded input data of the day.
